I have worked on “The Wealth of Nations” Project. This project focuses on three main aspects of the countries and measuring the wealth progress of the countries. To get better insights and understandings I have used Tableau visualization tool in my analysis process for this project. The project consists number of countries’ information but the client is only interested in the top 20 highest ranking countries. Also, the client is colour blind and requested to bear this in mind when building the dashboard. The three main areas to be considered as per the project content are: 
1.	GDP (Gross Domestic Product)
2.	Smartphone Users
3.	Life Expectancy at birth 
Further with the help of tableau I have created dashboard and graphs that imparts actionable insights. I have prepared four visuals in consideration of the above mentioned three key areas. From this evaluation, I have come on the conclusion that Monaco has the highest GDP of £190,513, Hong Kong has the highest life expectancy of 84.9 years and China with the highest smartphone usage of 1,598,360,000.
